Student 2: Edgar Zarazua,



compile command: g++ -std=c++11 listexpression.cpp -o listexpression

C++11 is used, the same as hw2, because g++ itself doesnt support the stoi() function, among a couple of others and throws errors.



run command: ./listexpression file=tc1.py

for input file tc1.py and inturn creates tc1.out 

**************

I've followed my base code that i developed for hw2 here in hw4 as well, using my own parser and maps key and value as the binding data structure to keep track of variable:data type and variable:data value.

Everything should work as expected. It has passed all 15 of the test cases. The program follows all the available details that was provided by the TA and the homework pdf.
